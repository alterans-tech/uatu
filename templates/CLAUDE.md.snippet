<!-- UATU FRAMEWORK - ADD THIS BLOCK AT THE TOP OF YOUR CLAUDE.md -->

## MANDATORY - Uatu Framework (DO NOT SKIP)

**You MUST use the Uatu framework for ALL tasks. No exceptions.**

### Hard Rules

1. **Read guides first** - Before any work, read `.uatu/guides/SEQUENTIAL-THINKING.md` and `.uatu/guides/TOOL-SELECTION.md`
2. **Sequential Thinking** - ALWAYS use Sequential Thinking MCP for every task, even "simple" ones
3. **Package Selection** - Select appropriate package based on task characteristics:
   - SOLO → Single file, clear task
   - SCOUT → Need to investigate/explore first
   - SQUAD → Multiple coordinated subtasks
   - BRAIN → Pattern learning (single session)
   - HIVE → Multi-session, persist context
   - WATCHER → Learning + persistence combined
4. **All artifacts in `.uatu/`** - NEVER create files in random places. All deliverables, specs, configs go in `.uatu/` folder
5. **Use Speckit commands** - For specifications, use `/speckit.*` commands, never create spec files manually

### Folder Structure

```
.uatu/
├── config/          # Project configuration
├── guides/          # Framework documentation
├── tools/           # Utilities (time-tracking, etc.)
└── delivery/        # All deliverables
    └── sprints/     # Feature specs, tasks, plans
```

### Quick Reference

| Task Type | Package | First Action |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Fix bug | SOLO | Sequential Thinking → identify scope |
| Explore codebase | SCOUT | Sequential Thinking → spawn Explore agents |
| Multi-file refactor | SQUAD | Sequential Thinking → swarm_init |
| Learn patterns | BRAIN | Sequential Thinking → daa_agent_create |
| Multi-day work | HIVE | Sequential Thinking → memory_namespace |
| Learn + remember | WATCHER | Sequential Thinking → both systems |

### Time Tracking

Ask "How much time have I worked?" to see work sessions.
